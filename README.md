<!-- Project Description -->
<p align="center">
  All the games in this project are made entirely with AI products like OpenAI's GPT-4o, o1 and o1-mini. 
  The process involves using a chat interface like ChatGPT to generate and update the games content. 
  After the primary content is generated, then I go into the code and update and add small elements i want changed, mostly variable values.
